# A fun little Go project

I wanted to try and learn a bit of Go, so I created this prototype that has a stopwatch and countdown functionality with an ascii art buddy that does something. It's kinda in-progress atm and there's probably bugs here and there and in core functionality like the timers themselves. Nevertheless It was kinda fun playing around with the ANSI escapes to try to make it work.

Will and demo and such some other time.
